A basic Rock-Paper-Scissors app made with SWiftUI.

Its a single view app, meaning that there are no additional views that it will transition to for each round.

The game on each turn randomly picks one of the three choices, and will prompt the player to pick the right choice to win or lose. If the player chooses the wrong answer then they lose a point, if they pick the correct answer they gain a point. After 10 questions the game stops and the player's score is displayed.
